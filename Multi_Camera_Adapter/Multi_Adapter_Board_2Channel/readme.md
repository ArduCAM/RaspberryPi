# Introduction
This multi-camera adapter board is designed for Raspberry pi ZERO and let your connect two 5MP cameras to Pi Zero.
Only one of the two cameras can be activated at a time, the are working in alternate ways.

It can not run two cameras at the same time, but we build a simple software which can run two cameras and make it looks working as the same time.
But the drawback is the frame rate and resolution will be fairly low, may be useful for surveillance.

Note that this version doesn't support 8MP Pi camera borad. And it also can be used for other Raspberry pi boards with minor software modifications.

# Prerequisites
Because the camera switching is done through the camera led pin.
You have to disable the automatic management of camera led in `/boot/config.txt`.  The following command help you  disable the led control from the GPU firmware.
```bash
$ sudo sh -c 'echo "disable_camera_led=1" >> /boot/config.txt' 
$ sudo reboot
```
# Hardware Connection
Connect the multi-camera adapter board to Pi ZERO through 15-22pin flex cable. And connect two 5MP pi cameras to the Camera A and Camera B ports as the following photo shows.

## Shell version

This shell script demonstrates how to take two still images from two cameras in turn.
* Run the script
```bash
cd RaspberryPi/Multi_Camera_Adapter/Multi_Adapter_Board_2Channel/shell

sudo chmod +x pi_cam.sh

sudo ./pi_cam.sh
```

## C++ version code

This example demonstrates to run two cameras and make them looks at the same time

* Install the opencv library
```Bash
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
```
* Compile and run
```Bash
cd RaspberryPi/Multi_Camera_Adapter/Multi_Adapter_Board_2Channel/c++/

sudo make
* For the use of remote control terminals, first specify the location of the image display
```Bash
export DISPLAY=:0
```

sudo ./pi_cam
```
